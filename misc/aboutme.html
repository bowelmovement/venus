<p>Trinity is a 21 year old girl living in one of the largest cities in midwest US. Highly sarcastic, cynical, stubborn and mildly geeky, she will be obtaining her B.S. in Computer Science at the end of 2006. She has a certain affinity to nature and international culture, as suggested by her food and music tastes. Her online presence extends back to 1999, but now she has claimed a little corner of the net with her collective,  <a href="http://ainoyume.net" target="_blank">Ainoyume.NET</a>. Although normally artistically driven with anime/manga, she has also dabbed a bit on the <a href="http://irrelevance.org" target="_blank">professional</a> side of web & graphic design. When she's not on the computer or buried under schoolwork, she is a humerous little girl with a big appetite. Thus at local Chinatowns, you will most likely find her in heated battle for peking duck and pig's stomach, or munching classic dim sum. Oh, and she's also addicted to those little Starbucks Frappuccino Mochas.
