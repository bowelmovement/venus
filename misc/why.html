<h5>Auxiliary &raquo; Pour Quoi? (why?)</h5>
<br>

<p>
It recently occurred to me that I don't have a "why" section on Total Venus Destination. This was due to an e-mail I received. The person asked me just why I liked Sailor Venus so much, and gave quite a few nasty comments. Unfortunately, the person's e-mail address was false, so I could not reply to him/her and address the issue properly. In turn, I've wrote down a couple of reasons why I like her, as well as answer some of the questions/comments s/he made about Minako. Most of it is already in <a href="http://venus.ainoyume.net/info/dumbblond.html">Just a Dumb Blond?</a>, which contains my opinions as well as facts.

<p align="justify">So why do I like Sailor Venus so much? Why is she my favorite out of all the senshi? The answer is quite simple, really. Minako is my favorite character of the BSSM series, she is hilarious, energetic, she is a comic relief of the series. She gets compared to Usagi a lot, but she's very different from her in many ways. 
<br><br>
<b>Comment 1: She's so dependent!</b>
<br><br>
On the contrary, she's not dependent at all. She is the true leader of the inner senshi, therefore, she has to make decisions on her own, look after her fellow senshi and get them out of trouble. She must think quick on her feet in crises and she does all of those. In the manga, she is much more powerful than seen in the anime. It was she who killed Queen Beryl and saved Usagi. 
<br><br>
<b>Comment 2: She's so easily hurt!</b>
<br><br>
She is easily hurt? Despite her close resemblance to the Love Goddess Aphrodite, she does not have a prefect love life. She cannot have a perfect love life, as Adonis had told her fortune and condemned that she would never have a successful love life. This is the reason she cannot keep a love and is hurt many times over. But she stands back up doesn't she? Every single time, she moves on because she has her duty as a senshi to devote herself to. She cries, but doesn't everyone? How many times has Usagi cried? Both Minako and Usagi are brave people and they have many human characteristics. No one goes through life without pain, conflicts, and problems. One must learn to overcome and deal with them in their own way.
<br><br>
<b>Comment 3: The Goddess of Love and Beauty is mean, spiteful and jealous!</b>
<br><br>
The true Goddess of Venus was not mean, spiteful, and jealous. Aphrodite's beauty is purely feminine and loveliness itself, and it is said that whereever Aphrodite stepped, flowers would blossom instantly. Aphrodite brings life and beauty into various things, just like how Minako has the ability of cheering people up when they're down, despite how she's feeling. This is an act of courage. <br><br>
<b>Comment 4: She's as a dog and she's a whore!</b>
<br><br>
I really don't see how she can be "as a dog" when she's achieved so much and Sailormoon would not be nearly the same without her. Perhaps you can tell me why you dislike her so much, and perhaps you should read the information on her before acknowledging and deciding that she's a "whore." I'm afraid you're being stereotypical here...does the fact that she has blond hair and blue eyes make her a whore? I think not. I suggest reading <a href="http://venus.ainoyume.net/info/dumbblond.html">Just a Dumb Blond?</a> to clear up your stereotypical views.
</p>

<p>Another reason I love Minako so much is that she's very much like me in a way. I resemble her in many ways, although I don't have blond hair or blue eyes. She's genki and fun-loving. She hides her problems and she doesn't like her mother much. Those are all traits that I share with Minako.^-^ I admire her courage and her ever-lasting smile, even when things aren't going so well, she manages to cheer people up. She has her flaws, she's not perfect, but that just makes her more human-like.<br><br><b>So, Why a shrine to Aino Minako?</b><br><br>Very good question. BSSM was the first anime I ever saw at age 8, and I fell in love with it immediately. At the time, I was probably more indulged in the action and comedy than the touching moments or those moments that made you think. I grew up with BSSM, and it will forever be my number one anime/manga. XD I love it now for different reasons, but overall, BSSM touches upon every aspect of human life. Love, hate, triumph, failure, courage, beauty, etc. Naoko dedicated her heart into producing the series as realistically as possible, and in turn made it a classic. But enough about BSSM. I made the shrine to Aino Minako because of all the reasons stated above. Plus, TVD was my first shrine, and has evolved greatly from its first debut. TVD holds a special place in my heart, as I love this site dearly. I keep it alive, for I still have the old BSSM fan in me. The viewers have been very supportive of TVD for the past years, and I am eternally grateful for that. I hope TVD will stay strong in the future. Thank you for your continuing support of TVD, and for keeping BSSM a treasured classic!
