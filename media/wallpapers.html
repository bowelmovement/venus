A very pastel and subtle wallpaper of Sailor V. The soft colors make desktop icons more visible. Thus this wallpaper is both aesthetic and functional.

I like the colors on this one, it's a nice shade of red/pink and it has one of my favorite manga images of Venus on there. I used a couple of brush effects here, but they weren't really needed. XD I haven't experienced with brushes for quite a while, so it might be a bit sloppy.

The colors on this one are pretty soothing as well. I didn't do much to this one, just chose some colors, added a few effects and the bigger background image, along with some words and voila!^^ It's pretty simple, but I still like it. :)

I didn't do anything with this wallpaper XD It was originally a screenshot and it was relatively big, so I resized it to fit the resolutions and added words.^^ This one was very simple, but I liked the background and the image overall, so I thought it'll make a good wallpaper.
