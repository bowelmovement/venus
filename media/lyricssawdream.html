Yuunagi no umi ni futari wa shai da ne   <br>
Totemo atatakai anata no yume wo mita wa  <br> 
Hatsukoi no you ni kokoro odoraseta   <br>
Sure chigau tabi ni tagai ni yasashiku nareta  <br><br> 

Hikarinagara warainagara sugiteiku kisetsu   <br>
Zutto futari kawaranai to shinjiteta   <br><br><br>

MY LOVE ano toki hanashita mirai no koto   <br>
AH koushite omoidaseba   <br>
Natsukashii dake nante   <br><br>

Tooi machi de ima wa donna yume wo miteiru no   
Mado wo akete aoi kaze ni kiite miru  <br><br>

Kagayaite itsu made mo

<b>English</b><br>
By the calm sea of the evening, we had lots of fun together   <br>
You, who are so warm to me, I saw your dream   <br>
Like this was our first love, our spirits were made to dance   <br>
Every time we passed by, we became so sweet with each other  <br><br>

As we shined together, as we laughed together, the seasons went by us <br>  
I believed that the two of us would never change  <br><br> 

My love, that time we talked about the future  <br> 
Ah, after it all, when I look back on it   <br>
Warm feelings are all I have   <br><br>

In a city far away, now what kind of dream are you dreaming  <br> 
Open the window, and I ask the cool wind for an answer   <br><br>

My love, even if you fall in love with somebody somewhere   <br>
Ah, once in a while, remember us in that corner of your heart   <br><br><br>

My love, with all our hearts we talked about the future <br>  
Ah, you are so radiant   <br>
Shine like that forever more
