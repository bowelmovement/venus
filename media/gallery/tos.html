<table cellpadding=5><tr><td><font color="#ED9395" face=verdana><b>Terms of Service</b><br>Running a gallery is hard, and to keep the gallery available throughout time is even harder. Therefore, rules must be enforced to enable prolonged maintainance of Aura of Venus. Below are some terms that users must agree to in order for Aura of Venus to be sustained. Please read carefully and follow the terms. Thank you for all of your efforts.
<p align=justify>First, these images are <font color=white><b>not to be DIRECTLY LINKED</b></font> (i.e. copying the exact URL of an image and pasting it on your site). I cannot stress this enough. If you do direct link, I <u>will find out</u> and there will be severe consequences. Honestly, people actually do this. How hard can it be to load them to your hard drive and upload them to your own server, with your own html and graphic designs? This is a serious offense and will not be tolerated.<p align=justify>Second, all of these images are free to use, whether they're for layouts or pictures accompanying information. However, I'd appreciate it if you would <font color=white><b>add a link back to me (aka credit me)</b></font> from your website if you do decide to use these for any sort of public usage. By this, I mean a credits page, not a links page where you have various Sailormoon/Image gallery sites listed. Presently, I do not have my link stamped on every single image, but it wouldn't hurt to give credit every now and then. Please link back to <a href="http://absoludicrous.net/venus/">http://absoludicrous.net/venus/</a>. Thank you.</p>
                <p align=justify>Finally, I do wish for anyone taking images for website usage to <font color=white><b>limit their takings of the images</b></font>. I really don't want my images to be duplicated to another identical gallery. I would like to stay unique and be able to provide others with a decent amount of good quality images. People use them for their shrines, if they want help illustrate their point(s), or for layouts, if they have a specific picture they want to use. Please limit your image takings to a small amount. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation. :)
