Clear Reflections (geocities.com/starry_night4)<br>
This site belongs to my good friend Rei.  She has helped me make transparent GIFs, make pictures, fade pics, and other stuff that I can't do cuz I didn't have PSP when I first started making my site.^_^ I don't know how to thank her enough because she never forgot what I asked her to do and her work is very well done! Thanx on behalf of Total Venus Destination and myself!

Thanks again minna-san! You guyz are the best and this is the best egroup!

Alpin's Sailor Moon Archives (moonlightprincess.com)<br>
Thank you for some of the venus images and most of the movie clips. This site has the most SM movie clips you'll ever find. They've also got tons of Venus images and Sailor Moon images. Highly recommended especially for those in need of images and movie clips.

Probably better known as Minako.com. Thanks to them for the awesome fanart pictures of sailor venus/minako. They have a wonderful collection, with mild hentai pics. I also use their pics for some of my layouts. Great site!

Big thanks to Artemisu for some of the Artemis images :) I no longer had the URL but the webmistress informed me. Thank you so much for allowing TVD to have the images.
