<h5>Asylum &raquo; Queries</h5>
<br>
<p>

Welcome to the FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) section. This is a relatively new section, since I've been getting e-mails/guestbook signitures asking about these topics. Please read them through before e-mailing me or posting a question on the guestbook. If I don't have your question up here, then please feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact</a> me.
</p>

<p><b>Question:</b> Can I take some of your images?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> If you are referring to my layout images, then no. I edited those images and they are my creation. Thus, they're copyrighted by me. But for the images in my image gallery, sure, as long as you link me. The point of the images is for you to enjoy them, draw them, put them on your site, etc. I scanned some of the images, and I've credited everyone who have assisted me on the remaining images. But it is plagiarism if you don't credit the owner or link them. Remember, plagiarism is illigal and you can be fined. And please, don't take all of my images. Thanks!
</p>

<p><b>Question:</b> I love your fanart! Can you draw me something?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> I do take commissions for a few bucks per fanart. It really depends on what needs to be done. Feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact</a> me if you're interested.
</p>

<p><b>Question:</b> Can I use your guestbook as an advertiser for my own site?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> Obviously, no. The guestbook is for people who want to leave their mark saying something about my site, whether it's compliments or constructive criticism. If you only post your site address(es) with a message saying "Please visit my site" or something similar, it will be deleted within 1 week.
</p>

<p>
<b>Question:</b> Can I become affiliates/sister sites with you?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> Actually, it depends on your site. But most of the time, yes, as long as you  have a BSSM related site. If you think you have a relatively good site, then <a href="contact.html">contact</a> me about it. This will give me a relatively clear idea of the quality of your site. I'll let you know if I accept you as an affiliate. But please don't be discouraged if I don't accept you. Feel free to apply again if you wish.
</p>

<p>
<b>Question:</b> Can you link me?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> I usually link sites that I'm fond of and/or my friends. If you want to be linked, send me a <a href="contact.html">notice</a> and I'll decide.</p>

<p>
<b>Question:</b> Why did you make a shrine to Sailor Venus?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> Please refer to the <a href="http://venus.ainoyume.net/misc/why.html" target="_top">Why</a> section.
