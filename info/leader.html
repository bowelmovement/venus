&raquo; <b>Proven Leader</b>
<p>
Sailor Venus seemed to be the last person someone would expect to be a leader. Much like Sailor Moon, she is ditzy and silly on the outside. Some think that Sailor Moon is the leader, but the actual fact states that Sailor Venus is indeed, the true leader. 
</p>  

<p><img align="left" border="0" src="images/leader1.png" style="margin:10px">The reason Sailor Moon is not the leader is because she is also Princess Serenity. It is the four sailor senshi's duty to protect the princess, and Sailor Venus is the lead protector of the princess. The show, being called Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon, revolves around Sailor Moon, but that doesn't necessarily mean that she is automatically the leader. She does seem like the leader, since she's always in the middle of the huddle, and/or the show's main focus. But when it comes down to who's the leader, it's been proven and confirmed that Sailor Venus is, without a doubt, the leader of the sailor senshi.

<p>Being a leader is an honor and an important role, and definitely not all fun and games. The leader needs to know when to think and to take action, to maintain composure among the team, and to confidently direct the team. At the same time, they need to be encouraging and optimistic. Moreover, they have to make sure that no one gets left behind, and never leave a teammate in trouble. Sailor Venus demonstrates all of these qualities, as well as previous experiences as a senshi. Sailor Venus brings out all of the senshi's best qualities. She pushes the others to be their best, and at the same time, she encourages them to keep going even in the roughest moments. This is shown much more in the manga, however. In the anime, there are less evidence of her leadership, but there are some. To illustrate briefly, she led the Sailor team's Sailor Planet Attack in the R movie. In one of the S episodes, Hotaru told the sailor senshi to leave the crazy dimension that they were trapped in without her, because they only had enough power to carry Chibi-Usa along. Sailor Venus, as well as the other senshi, told her that they will never leave a friend behind, and that if they couldn't take Hotaru along, they wouldn't go either. Sailor Venus has had doubts about her role as a leader, but she overcomes it, as always, and continues going forward. Time after time, she has proven herself to be worthy of the title of a leader, and she will sacrifice even her own life, if it means saving the world or saving her princess.

<p><img align="right" border="0" src="images/leader2.png" style="margin:10px">Being a leader also means knowing what to do when a senshi or the entire team is in trouble. Sailor Venus has the ability to use her love chain attack to damage enemies, but she also knows that it can be utilized as a chain to pull herself up. She's demonstrated this useful technique quite a few times throughout the season, for instance in one of the Stars episode, where she used it to catch Sailor Pluto and herself to prevent from falling.</p>
