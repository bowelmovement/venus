She is undoubtly beautiful and she's very feminine.^_^ She is very open to new people, yet carries the secret of her tainted past within her. If Katrina hadn't come to Tokyo, Usagi would have never found out about her past. Although she is happy when she's around her friends, sometimes Minako sits along on a swing, thinking about her destiny and fate. She is certainly more happy when she is in love, because love truely brings out the best and purest form of a person.
