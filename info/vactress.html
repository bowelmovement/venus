Who has the lovely voice behind our beloved Goddess of Love and Beauty? The voice belongs to Fukami Rica. She was employed by Doujinsha Production and also has the voice roles of Aquelda from Ai Tenshi Densetsu Wedding Peach, Myun Fan Lon from Macross Plus, and Riara from Record of the Lodoss War. Aside from being the voice of Aino Minako in the Sailor Moon series, she is also the voice of Nishimura Reika and Rikoukeidar in Sailor Moon. She is also a wonderful singer, and some of her solos include Hoshizora no Fuuga, Mornin' After, and La Venus.

She's sung singles as well as songs with the other seiyuu of the Sailor Senshi. She is a member of "Peach Hips," a group made up of the 5 seiyuu of the original sailor senshi from Sailor Moon.

<p>Personally, I think she has a lovely voice for singing, and Route Venus just wouldn't sound right without her voice. (I listened to the MIDI version of Route Venus, which had no lyrics) Her voice for Aino Minako really portrays Minako-chan's personality, but maybe that's because I'm so used to it. I didn't really like her voice in the beginning, probably because it sounded so unusual, especially in Japanese.^_^But throughout the episodes, I gradually started to like her voice, noticing how it brings out Minako's uniqueness and individuality.
