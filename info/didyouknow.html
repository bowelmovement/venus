So you wanna see if you are a Sailor Venus pro? Or are you eager to find out just everything you want to know about the Goddess of Love and Beauty? Either way, this is the place to find out if you are a Sailor Venus pro or a soon-to-be one...check these out. 
</p>

<p><b>You Knew:</b><br>
- from her stats that she had a problem with her mom and the police... <br>
<b>But did you know:</b><br>
- why? Well, while in England fighting as Sailor V, her fame was so great that it became a threat even to the police. They considered her to be their enemy simply because she was making them look bad and worthless. 
<br>
- her mom, on the other side, was described as a "screaming hag" around her house.^_^ She didn't like being bossed around by her mom, who was always telling her to clean her room, change her uniform, etc. For this reason, she envied Rei, who didn't have a mom. 
</p>
<p><b>You Knew:</b><br>
- that she fought in England as Sailor V before coming to Tokyo. <br>
<b>But did you know:</b><br>
- that she faked Sailor V's death and made all of England believe that she was dead? That's the reason she came to Tokyo to join up with the rest of the senshi. 
</p>
<p><b>You Knew:</b><br>
- that Naoko Takeuchi created a Sailor Moon manga and a Sailor V manga. <br>
<b>But did you know:</b><br>
- that she created Sailor Venus BEFORE Sailor Moon? That's why the Sailor V manga came out before the Sailor Moon manga. That's also the reason why Sailor Venus and Sailor Moon are so much alike. 
</p>
<p><b>You Knew:</b><br> 
- that there was a Sailor V manga. <br>
<b>But did you know:</b><br>
- that she based the Sailor V manga on herself? That she's most like Sailor Venus? 
</p>
<p>
<b>You Knew:</b><br>
- that she had a bow in her hair all of the time. <br>
<b>But did you know:</b><br>
- why? According to the Sailor V manga, a youma from the Dark Kingdom was telling girls in Minako's school that they should put a bow in their hair to make it pretty. Minako did so after defeating the youma, and just kept it in there since then.
</p>
<p><b>Did you know:</b><br>
- that advertising was also present in some episodes.  Usagi and Rei are often seen reading copies of Sailor V and other popular manga.
</p>
<p>
<b>Did you know:</b><br>
- that some Sailor Moon episodes contain subliminal imagery.  For example, when you stop-action on Usagi's transformation in the first season, you will find that the twinkle in the tiara's jewel is actually made up of several brief images, including Usagi herself, Sailor Venus, and the moon princess battling Queen Beryl.
</p>
<p><b>You Knew:</b><br>
- that Usagi is the Moon Princess.<br>
<b>But did you know:</b><br>
- that Minako was the original Moon Princess before Naoko changed the plot?
